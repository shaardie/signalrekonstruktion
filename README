These small scripts arised while i was writing my master thesis. they were
intended to create the data for the numerical experiments.

I use octave ( http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/ ) to execute them. It should
be noted that for some of the scripts the semidefinite solver CSDP 
( https://projects.coin-or.org/Csdp/ ) is needed.

Feel free to use or change these scripts.
